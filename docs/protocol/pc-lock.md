# PC lock (service 22)

**Status in this project:** Implemented. The phone's "PC lock" tile appears and the lock request
reaches the PC, which runs `loginctl lock-session` (Linux) or the bundled `smartconnect-mac-helper
lock-screen` (macOS, verified on a device: the screen locks and the daemon reports the unlock
through the helper's `session-locked-wait` stream). On Linux whether the screen visibly locks
depends on the desktop's screen locker: some lockers do not react to logind's lock signal, in which
case nothing locks and the PC reports "unlocked" a few seconds later.

**Implementation:** [`src/pc_lock.rs`](../../src/pc_lock.rs).

## Overview

The phone can lock the PC it is connected to. The PC reports the lock state back so the phone's tile
can follow it (OBSERVED in the phone app).

The phone only registers its handler for this PC when the PC advertises `serviceVersions["22"] >= 2`
(Windows sends `2`, and so does this project) (OBSERVED in the phone app). The tile also needs `"22"`
in the PC's service 25 `cap` map (see [device-status-and-tiles.md](device-status-and-tiles.md)).

## Commands

| cmd | Direction | Meaning | Payload | Tag |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | phone → PC | Lock now | `{"ver": "1", "cmd": 1}` | OBSERVED on a device |
| 2 | PC → phone | Lock state | `{"ver": "1", "cmd": 2, "state": 1}` once locked, `{"ver": "1", "cmd": 2, "state": 0}` once unlocked | OBSERVED (code) |

## Main flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Phone
    participant PC as PC
    P->>PC: svc 22 cmd 1 (lock)
    PC->>PC: lock the session
    PC->>P: svc 22 cmd 2 (state 1)
    Note over PC: user unlocks the PC
    PC->>P: svc 22 cmd 2 (state 0)
```

This project reports `state: 1` after a successful `loginctl lock-session`, then polls logind's
`LockedHint` every 2 s and reports `state: 0` when it turns false.

## Pitfalls

1. **The locker must react to logind.** With a locker that ignores logind's lock signal,
   `LockedHint` stays false, so the PC reports "unlocked" a few seconds later and nothing visibly locks.
2. **Version 2 or higher.** With `"22": 1` or no entry, the phone never sends the request.

## Open questions

- Whether the phone expects `cmd 2` within a time limit, and what it shows if `state: 1` never comes.
