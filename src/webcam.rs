//! Service 3 (Webcam tile): the phone's camera as a Linux webcam.
//!
//! The daemon only relays signalling. The media is a WebRTC session (H.264 over DTLS-SRTP/UDP)
//! straight from the phone to the `smartconnect-webcam` helper, which decodes it and feeds
//! v4l2loopback or a PipeWire camera node; see `webcam/` and `evidence-2026-10-20/webcam-spec.md`.
//!
//! What the daemon does itself: when the user taps Webcam on the phone, the phone sends svc 3
//! `cmd 0` with `isReply:0` and waits for the PC to agree. If no helper is running, `helpers.rs`
//! starts `smartconnect-webcam --answer`, which replies and runs the session. (The Windows app's
//! `/readyfor/webcam` route is a loopback-only WebSocket for its own UI; the phone never uses it.)
