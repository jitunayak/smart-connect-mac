//! Automatic app-icon fetch. On every connection (and on each service 17 `cmd 2` someone sends)
//! the phone sends its app list as service 17 `cmd 1` and, alongside it, offers the icons over its
//! fex transfer server. We pull them into the app-icon cache
//! (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/smartconnect-linux/app-icons/`, see [`smartconnect_fex::icons`]) where the GUI
//! finds them by `iconName`.
//!
//! The pull runs in the background so the session loop never waits on it. Completing it also
//! matters to the phone: only after the receiver reports the transfer complete does it send its
//! recent-apps list (service 17 `cmd 10`), as it does for the Windows PC.
//!
//! One fetch at a time, across processes: if the icon lock is held (another fetch in this daemon,
//! or `smartconnect-fex fetch-app-icons`, which takes it before asking the phone) the offer is
//! left to the holder. `SMARTCONNECT_APP_ICONS=0` turns the automatic fetch off.
